Issue 1: CSV Import Error (q3q4 File)

Error: When importing the q3q4.csv file into pgAdmin, an error was encountered indicating an issue with a comma in row 2 (date column at the end).
Resolution: Opened the file in Excel, identified and removed the problematic entry, then reattempted the upload.

Issue 2: Invalid Input Syntax for Integer (q1 File - birthyear Column)

During import, pgAdmin returned the following error:
ERROR: invalid input syntax for type integer: ""
CONTEXT: COPY q1, line 34, column birthyear: ""
Cause: The birthyear column contained empty values, which are incompatible with the INTEGER data type.

Solution: Handling Empty Values in birthyear Column

Initially changed birthyear to a STRING to allow the data to be imported.
Replaced empty values with 0 to maintain integer compatibility:
UPDATE q1
SET birthyear = '0'
WHERE birthyear = '';

Verified the update:
SELECT birthyear FROM q1 WHERE birthyear = 0;
Converted birthyear back to an INTEGER:
ALTER TABLE q1
ALTER COLUMN birthyear TYPE INTEGER USING birthyear::INTEGER;

Next Steps

Apply the same data cleaning and conversion steps for q2, q3, and q4 before importing into the SQL database.
