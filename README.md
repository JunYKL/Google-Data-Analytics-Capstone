1) How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

Subscribers account for over half of the total rides: 2.1 billion compared to 1.55 billion by customers (casual users).

Afternoon has the highest ride volume, followed by morning, indicating heavy usage possibly for commuting or mid-day travel.

Customer (Casual) riders may be more active in the afternoon and evening, while subscribers may ride more in mornings

Routes are concentrated around popular areas like Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, Theater on the Lake, and Lake Shore Dr, which are common leisure or tourist locations — more likely used by casual riders.

2) Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

Casual riders already use high-traffic scenic routes frequently.

They ride more during good weather months (May–September), shown in the Monthly Ride Distribution bar chart.

If these riders take frequent trips in summer or weekends, a membership could save them money.

3) How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
   
Target social media and mobile ads during peak casual usage months (May–August).

Use geo-targeted ads near scenic and tourist-heavy routes (e.g., Theater on the Lake, Lake Shore Dr) with prompts like:
“Ride more? Save more. Go annual and enjoy unlimited rides!”

Share personalized summaries: “You rode 5 times last month. A membership would’ve saved you $X.”
